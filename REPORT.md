# Othello MCTS Fixes\n\n## What was wrong\n- `OthelloState.legal_actions()` never exposed a pass move when only the opponent had legal moves. Search algorithms (especially MCTS) would see zero legal actions in non-terminal states, producing empty policies or treating nodes as terminal.\n- MCTS root handling relied on `legal_actions()` and thus failed to expand pass-only nodes, leading to incorrect policies and weaker play.\n\n## Changes made\n- Added optional `include_pass` support to `OthelloRules.legal_actions` and enabled it in `OthelloState.legal_actions` so pass shows up when required.\n- Added regression tests covering pass legality and ensuring MCTS returns a pass move with a proper policy when no other actions are available.\n\n## How to test\n- Run the test suite:\n  - `pytest tests/test_othello_rules.py::test_pass_legal_action_when_only_opponent_has_moves`\n  - `pytest tests/test_mcts_othello.py::test_mcts_returns_pass_when_only_pass_is_legal`\n*** End Patch ***!
